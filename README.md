# OpenFoodFacts

## Presentation

The aim if this project is to create an application than can use the data of the **OpenFoodFacts** open database.

"*Open Food Facts gathers information and data on food products from around the world.*"
*https://world.openfoodfacts.org/*

In this project, we will clean and explore the OpenFoodFacts database to evaluate the feasability of our application.

This project is divided into two notebooks:
* In the first notebook, we will clean and filter the OpenFoodfacts data which is constituted of around 2 millions samples.
* In the second notebook we will statistically explore the filtered dataset in order to evaluate the feasability of our application.

In addition, we will also focus on creating tools to automate the exploration of datasets, whichever they are. This will enable us to quickly and efficiently explore datasets, in a transverse way, in the future.
